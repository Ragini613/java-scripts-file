I built a QR code generator that lets users input text or URLs and generates a corresponding QR code. 
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple interface and integrated the QRServer API for QR code generation.

The project was a great learning experience that showcased my skills in front-end development and API integration.
I faced some challenges, but I was able to overcome them and create a functional tool.

In the future, I'd like to add some enhancements, such as error handling and a download feature for generated QR codes.
Overall, I'm proud of what I've accomplished and look forward to building on this foundation in future projects.
